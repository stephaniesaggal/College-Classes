	<audio src="musica.mp3" controls="controls"></audio>

	<p>So I never really knew you<br>
	God I really tried to<br>
	Blindsided, addicted<br>
	Felt we could really do this<br>
	But really I was foolish<br>
	Hindsight it's<br>
	Obvious<br>
	Talking with my lawyer she said<br>
	"Where'd you find this guy?"<br>
	I said, "Young people fall in love"<br>
	"With the wrong people sometimes"<br>
	Some mistakes get made<br>
	That's alright, that's okay<br>
	You can think that you're in love<br>
	When you're really just in pain<br>
	Some mistakes get made<br>
	That's alright, that's okay<br>
	In the end it's better for me<br>
	That's the moral of the story babe<br>
	That's the moral of the story babe<br>
	Oh, oh<br>
	Oh-ooh-oh<br>
	Woo, oh<br>
	Oh-ooh<br>
	It's funny how a memory<br>
	Turns into a bad dream<br>
	When running wild turns volatile<br>
	Remember how we painted our house?<br>
	Just like my grandparents did, so romantic<br>
	But we fought the whole time<br>
	Should have seen the signs, yeah<br>
	Talking with my mother she said<br>
	"Where'd you find this guy?"<br>
	I said, "Some people fall in love"<br>
	"With the wrong people sometimes"<br>
	Some mistakes get made<br>
	That's alright, that's okay<br>
	You can think that you're in love<br>
	When you're really just in pain<br>
	Some mistakes get made<br>
	That's alright, that's okay<br>
	In the end it's better for me<br>
	That's the moral of the story babe<br>
	Oh, oh<br>
	Oh-ooh-oh<br>
	Woo, oh<br>
	Oh-ooh-oh<br>
	Oh, oh<br>
	Oh-ooh-oh<br>
	Woo, oh<br>
	Oh-ooh<br>
	They say it's better to have loved and lost<br>
	Than never to have loved at all<br>
	That could be a load of <br>
	But I just need to tell you all<br>
	Some mistakes get made<br>
	That's alright, that's okay<br>
	You can think that you're in love<br>
	When you're really just engaged<br>
	Some mistakes get made<br>
	That's alright, that's okay<br>
	In the end it's better for me<br>
	That's the moral of the story<br>
	Some mistakes get made<br>
	That's alright, that's okay<br>
	You can think that you're in love<br>
	When you're really just in pain<br>
	Some mistakes get made<br>
	That's alright, that's okay<br>
	In the end it's better for me<br>
	That's the moral of the story babe<br>
	Oh, oh<br>
	Oh-ooh-oh<br>
	Woo, oh<br>
	Oh-ooh-oh<br>
	Oh, oh<br>
	Oh-ooh-oh<br>
	Woo, oh<br>
	Oh-ooh, oh<br>
	Oh, oh<br>
	Oh-ooh-oh<br>
	Woo, oh<br>
	Oh-ooh</p>
